#PHOSCnet PyTorch implementation

PHOSCnet version for recognizing handwritten words in images based on the PHOSCnet from the paper: *Anuj Rai, Narayanan C. Krishnan, Sukalpa Chanda:
Pho(SC)Net: An Approach Towards Zero-shot Word Image Recognition in Historical Documents. ICDAR (1) 2021: page:19-33

This is a PyTorch implementation based on the TensorFlow implementation found in this repository:
https://github.com/anuj-rai-23/PHOSC-Zero-Shot-Word-Recognition 

Converting the code TensorFlow from the original research paper to PyTorch
was given as an assignment in the course DTE-2602 (Neural Networks) 
at UiT - The Arctic University of Norway
